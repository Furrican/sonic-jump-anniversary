          <strong>JUMPING AND MOVING:</strong><br>
          The playable character (like Sonic) jumps automatically by spinning in a ball, and they stop spinning when he falls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Move the character left or right by tilting your device to make the character land on platforms.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <br><img src="screenshots/beginners1.png" class="center">
        <p>
          <strong>SUPER JUMP (DOUBLE JUMP):</strong><br>
          You can also perform a double jump by touching the screen. Perform a double jump at the highest point of the initial jump to jump higher and reach higher platforms.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <br><img src="screenshots/beginners2.png" class="center">
        <p>
          <strong>VIRTUAL PAD:</strong><br>
          If you have turned <strong>ON</strong> the <strong>VIRTUAL PAD</strong> option, you will control the character by pressing one of the available icons at the bottom of the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          The arrows make the character moving, whereas the "select" icon makes the character perform a double jump.
        </p>
        <img src="screenshots/beginners3.png" class="center">
        <p>
          <span style="color: yellow;">Additionally, there are hidden buttons on top of the arrows to move left or right and perform a double jump at the same time.</span>

        <p>
          <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong><br>
          The platforms allow you to jump on. Jump on higher platforms to reach the top of the stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are multiple types of platforms in the game and some of them can move from left to right.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <br><img src="screenshots/beginners5.png" class="center">
        <p>
          <strong>FRAGILE PLATFORMS:</strong><br>
          Some platforms may be fragile. When you land on one, it breaks into pieces and you have to wait for a few seconds for the platform to reappear.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <br><img src="screenshots/beginners6.png" class="center">
        <p>
          <strong>SPIKE PLATFORMS:</strong><br>
          Some platforms may also have spikes underneath them. If you touch the spikes, you will get hit.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <br><img src="screenshots/beginners7.png" class="center">
        <p>
          <strong>SPRING PLATFORMS:</strong><br>
          The spring platforms allow the character to jump even higher.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="block">
        <br><img src="screenshots/beginners8.png" class="center">
        <p>
          <strong>BADNIKS:</strong><br>
          Badniks are robots created by Dr. Eggman. You can defeat a Badnik by jumping towards it.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>But be careful not to touch a badnik when the character is not spinning, or else you get hit.</strong>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <br><img src="screenshots/beginners9.png" class="center">
        <p>
          <strong>GREEN HOOPS:</strong><br>
          Green hoops allow you to earn more points by passing through them.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <br><img src="screenshots/beginners10.png" class="center">
        <p>
          <strong>BLUE HOOPS:</strong><br>
          Blue hoops allow you to launch the character high at a fast speed.<br>
          Like the green hoops, they also allow you to earn more points by passing through them.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>To use a blue hoop, the character must pass through it from below.</strong>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <br><img src="screenshots/beginners11.png" class="center">
        <p>
          <strong>CHECKPOINTS:</strong><br>
          If you land on a platform with a checkpoint on it, you will restart from this platform after losing a life, instead of restarting from the beginning of the stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Be careful when you are at your last life.</strong> Because if you lost at this point, your game is over and you have to restart from the beginning of the stage to clear it.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <br><img src="screenshots/beginners12.png" class="center">
        <p>
          <strong>EGGMAN MACHINES:</strong><br>
          At the end of Act 3 in each zone, Dr. Eggman descends in a flying machine. A life gauge also appears at the bottom of the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have to defeat Dr. Eggman to clear the stage. <strong>Hit the machine while jumping in a ball to attack</strong>. If the life gauge is empty, Dr. Eggman's machine is broken and he lives the area.
        </p>
        <p>
          The machine is equipped either with spikes bars or spikes balls, depending on the zone. Learn the attack patterns to avoid getting hit and counter-attack effectively.
        </p>
      </div>
      <br><hr><h1 id="rings">Rings and Lives</h1>
      <div class="block">
        <p>
          The rings are scattered around in the stages. They are an essentail item to collect and serve multiple purposes.
        </p>
        <br><img src="screenshots/beginners13.png" class="center">
        <p>
          <strong>SURVIVE DAMAGE:</strong><br>
          The main use of the rings is to protect the player from damage. When you get hit, you lose 10 rings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be careful not to get hit when you have 0 rings, or else you will lose a life.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you collect 50 or 100 rings, you will earn an extra life.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <br><img src="screenshots/beginners14.png" class="center">
        <p>
          <strong>EMERALD SHARDS:</strong><br>
          If you clear a stage with at least 50 rings, you can earn an emerald shard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Collect all emerald shards in the game to unlock the Bonus Zone and end the story.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <br><img src="screenshots/beginners15.png" class="center">
        <p>
          <strong>RESTARTING A STAGE:</strong><br>
          If you lose a life, you will lose all the rings you have collected in a stage and get less chance to earn an emerald shard at the end of the stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          While losing, you can pause the game and restart the stage from the beginning. Doing so will also preserve your extra lives.
