        <p>
          <strong>FIRST STEPS:</strong><br>
          The <strong>Map Editor</strong> is a feature that allows you to check the different game maps and even modify them to test them out!
        </p>
        <p>When entering the <strong>Map Editor</strong>, you will see the top layout of the first stage. You can check the stage layout by sliding or zooming the stage canvas.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="block5">
        <p>
          <strong>MENUS & OPTIONS:</strong><br>
          At the top of the screen is a selection of menus and options. You can find the different usage of each option by checking the different sections of this page.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>PLAY MAP</strong>, <strong>SAVE MAP</strong> and <strong>LOAD MAP</strong> options are explained in the <strong>Map Files</strong> instructions.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block5">
        <br><img class="center" src="screenshots/maps1.png">
        <p><strong>MUSIC:</strong><br>
          The <strong>MUSIC CONTROLS</strong> menu is where you can select a custom music for your stages.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, you need to select a music by going through a library of soundtracks. Select your preferred music and it will be played in the background of the editor.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the music is played, you can turn it off by pressing <strong>Pause/Resume Music</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, to use the selected music to be played in your stage, you need to check the Custom Music option in the <strong>CONFIG</strong> menu.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also listen to music by pressing the <strong>AMBIENT MUSIC</strong> option.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block5">
        <br><img class="center" src="screenshots/maps2.png">
        <p><strong>SELECT ROOM:</strong><br>
          The stages in the editor are named rooms. There are 21 rooms in total in the game to check and modify.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><span style="color: orange;">DISCLAMER:</span> Changing rooms makes you lose your stage layout modifications. Make sure to save and load your map before changing rooms to keep your modifications.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are the zones that the rooms represent:<br>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Room 1</strong>: Green Hill Zone</li>
            <li><strong>Room 2</strong>: Blue Sky Zone</li>
            <li><strong>Room 3</strong>: Mechanical Zone</li>
            <li><strong>Room 4</strong>: Mountain Zone</li>
            <li><strong>Room 5</strong>: Jungle Zone</li>
            <li><strong>Room 6</strong>: Cosmic Zone</li>
            <li><strong>Room 7</strong>: Bonus Zone</li>

        <p>
          <strong>CONFIG MENU:</strong><br>
          The <strong>CONFIG</strong> menu is where you can configure additional stage settings.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><span style="color: orange;">DISCLAMER:</span> The CONFIG menu doesn't track all configured settings after saving. Meaning that to make an additional modification, you have to configure all settings again.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are the different settings available:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Life Count</strong>: Set the life counter to start the stage with a specific number of remaining lives (2 by default).</li>
            <li><strong>Stage Name</strong>: Change the name of the stage (zone name by default).</li>
            <li><strong>Act Number</strong>: Change the act number of the stage (1, 2 or 3 by default).</li>
            <li><strong>BLOCKPICS</strong>: Change the sprites of the platforms and enemy.</li>
            <li><strong>EDGEPICS</strong>: Change the side background of the stage.</li>
            <li><strong>EXTRASPIC</strong>: Change the sprites of the ring, spring platform and Dr. Eggman.</li>
            <li><strong>STRIPPICS</strong>: Change the background environment of the stage.</li>
            <li><strong>TILESPICS</strong>: Change the background tiles of the stage.</li>
            <li><strong>Custom Music</strong>: When checked, the stage will play the selected music from the <strong>MUSIC CONTROLS</strong> menu.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block5">
        <p>
          <strong>ADDITIONAL OPTIONS:</strong><br>
          The black/colored box on the top-right side of the screen is actually an option. It allows you to change the color of the stage canvas.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>RESET MAP</strong> option allows you to reset the stage layout. You can bring the stage layout back by selecting the same stage room in the <strong>SELECT ROOM</strong> menu.

        <p>
          <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong><br>
          In the <strong>Map Editor</strong>, the stage layouts are represented by objects. Each object has its type number and coordinates.
        </p>
        <p>
          The coordinates are represented by the X and Y positions. The X position can go from between 0 to 15 from left to right, whereas the Y position can go from from 0 to 65535 from top to bottom.
        </p>
        <p>
          When selecting an empty space, you will be granted with a list of object types. You can also select a placed object to change its type or remove it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some object placements are determined by gray sprites next to the visual object sprite to illustrate the accurate in-game object postions.
        </p>

          <strong>OBJECT TYPES LIST:</strong><br>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Type 0</strong>: Basic platform</li>
            <li><strong>Type 1</strong>: Fragile platform</li>
            <li><strong>Type 2</strong>: Spike platform</li>
            <li><strong>Type 3</strong>: Ring</li>
            <li><strong>Type 4</strong>: Spring platform</li>
            <li><strong>Type 5</strong>: Green hoop</li>
            <li><strong>Type 6</strong>: Blue hoop</li>
            <li><strong>Type 7</strong>: Enemy</li>
            <li><strong>Type 8</strong>: Goal post (check its section for more information)</li>
            <li><strong>Type 9</strong>: Basic platform (moving)</li>
            <li><strong>Type 10</strong>: Twinkling stars</li>
            <li><strong>Type 11</strong>: Spring platform (moving)</li>
            <li><strong>Type 12</strong>: Spike platform (moving)</li>
            <li><strong>Type 13</strong>: Fragile platform (moving)</li>
            <li><strong>Type 14</strong>: Checkpoint (check its section for more information)</li>

        <p>
          <strong>STARTING POINT:</strong><br>
          The starting point of the stage is determined by the lowest basic platform placed (Type 0). Any other objects placed below won't be present in the stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you place multiple basic platforms at the lowest, the starting point will be the platform placed to the right. There is no other way to change the starting point position.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block4">
        <p>
          <br><img class="center" src="screenshots/maps6.png">
          <strong>CHECKPOINTS:</strong><br>
          Checkpoints must be placed in a specific way to work correctly. Here are the instructions on how to use them:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Checkpoints must be placed on a basic platform (Type 0) at a Y position of 1 heigher than the basic platform.</strong> You can placed a platform either at the same X position or 2 to the right, but 1 to the right is recommended.</li>
            <li><strong>If you place a platform next to another with a checkpoint on top, you have to land on this new platform to activate the checkpoint.</strong> It is recommended to remove this platform to prevent this glitch to occur.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block4">
        <p>
          <strong>GOAL POST:</strong><br>
          The goal post is a necessary object type to clear a stage. It serves multiple purpose depending on the stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          In ACT 1 and 2 stages, the goal post represents the end of the stage. Reach the height of the goal post to clear the stage.
        </p>
        <img class="center" src="screenshots/maps7.png">
        <p>
          In ACT 3 stages, the goal post makes you ascend until a certain height. The goal post is necessary to make Dr. Eggman appear.<br>
          Dr. Eggman is located at the highest position of the stage. He must be defeated to clear the stage.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
          You can add multiple goal posts to make you ascend even more, but doing so will make Dr. Eggman behave faster each time.

      <div class="block6">
        <p>
          <strong>SAVE MAP:</strong><br>
          When pressing <strong>SAVE MAP</strong> for the first time, you have to select a folder to determine the <strong>SonicJump subfolder</strong> directory, where your modified map files will be saved.
        </p>
        <img class="center" src="screenshots/maps8.png">
        <p>
          After selecting a folder directory, pressing <strong>SAVE MAP</strong> will ask you save your map as a .bin or .txt file.
        </p>
        <p>
          The .bin format is meant for saving maps without any extra settings. This format takes less space.
        </p>
        <p>
          The .txt format is meant for saving maps with additional features in the stages such as custom music and graphics.
        </p>
        <p>
          The map files don't overwrite, so anytime you save a map file, it creates another one. So make sure to track down your progress.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block6">
        <p>
          <strong>LOAD MAP:</strong><br>
          Anytime you enter the <strong>Map Editor</strong>, it loads the regular game map by default. If you want to check your map, you have to load it.
        </p>
        <p>
          To load your progress, press the <strong>LOAD MAP</strong> option and search for a <strong>map.bin</strong> or <strong>decoded_map.txt</strong> file located in the <strong>SonicJump subfolder</strong>.<br>
          This folder is most probably located in the <strong>Download</strong> folder of your internal device.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block6">
        <br><img class="center" src="screenshots/maps9.png">
        <p>
          <strong>PLAY MAP:</strong><br>
          After loading or saving your map, you can play and test it by pressing <strong>PLAY MAP</strong>. This option will bring you to the Stage Select menu.
        </p>
        <p>
          Select the corresponding stage to play your modified stage.<br>
          For example: if you have made your own stage in Room 1-1, you have to select the first stage of the game to play it.
