          <strong>CHARACTER DESCRIPTION:</strong><br>
          Shadow the Hedgehog, known as the Ultimate Lifeform created by Prof. Gerald Robotnik, is a very powerful hedgehog with incredible skills and have no fear taking risks.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Sonic Jump Anniversary, Shadow is an alternative playable character to Sonic.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Shadow the Hedgehog is basically offering a faster, yet harder gameplay experience, making him an interesting character to play as for experts.</strong>

          <strong>CHARACTER PHYSICS:</strong><br>
          Shadow moves just like Sonic, but he can jump higher than Sonic.
        </p>
        <img src="screenshots/shadow2.png" class="center">
        <p>
          However, Shadow's double jump acts differently. His double jump is shorter and makes Shadow fall faster after using it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of Shadow's physics, you have act differently in order to better play the game.<br>
          The next section will teach you the different skills you can perform to play very well as Shadow.

        <p>
          <strong>JUMPING ON PLATFORMS QUICKER:</strong><br>
          Since Shadow is jumping higher than Sonic, you have to prioritize higher platforms than usual to get up faster.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you land on a higher platform correctly, Shadow will jump from platforms to platforms even quicker.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <br><img src="screenshots/shadow3.png" class="center">
        <p>
          <strong>BEWARE OF YOUR HEIGHTS:</strong><br>
          Be careful when you jump too high. Because the platforms below Shadow may not be accessible at a certain height.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make sure to move Shadow quickly to the next platform before he falls.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <p>
          <strong>DOUBLE JUMP TO LAND FASTER:</strong><br>
          Shadow's double jump makes him fall faster, meaning that he can also land on platforms faster.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you are about to land on another platform you want to jump from, perform a double jump at the right time to land faster on it.
        </p>
        <br><img src="screenshots/shadow4.png" class="center">
        <p>
          The best example of this are the spring platforms in the first stage of Green Hill Zone.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Sonic, you can land and jump quicker. But as Shadow, he takes time to land on each spring platform.<br>
          <span style="color: lime;">However, by performing double jumps at the right time, Shadow takes less time to use these spring platforms.</span>
        </p>

      <div class="block">
        <br><img src="screenshots/shadow5.png" class="center">
        <p>
          <strong>LESSER REACTION TIME:</strong><br>
          Because of Shadow's faster agility, you have less time reacting to the obstacles above.<br>
          Therefore, it is recommended for beginners to play as Sonic first and learn the layout of each stage.
        </p>
      </div>

        <p>
          <strong>DURING BOSS BATTLES:</strong><br>
          Shadow jumps so high he can reach Dr. Eggman's height easily during some battles, but it is more difficult to avoid the obstacles and land yourself to jump and attack Dr. Eggman.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>If you perform the double jump at the lowest point as possible of the jump, you can make a smaller jump if you want to stay around the same height and prevent yourself from jumping too high on the area.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to defeat Dr. Eggman as Shadow, you need faster reaction and good use of the double jump ability.
