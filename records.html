          <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong><br>
          <strong>SPEEDRUN MODE</strong> is a new game mode of Sonic Jump Aniversary. The goal of this mode is to clear all the stages all fast as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          In <strong>SPEEDRUN MODE</strong>, the life counter is replaced by a timer. Make sure to clear all the stages before the timer runs out to complete this game mode.<br>
          If you have completed this mode, your time record will be saved in the <strong>SPEEDRUN MODE</strong> page of the <strong>RECORDS</strong> menu.
        </p>

          <strong>LANDING ON PLATFORMS QUICKLY:</strong><br>
          First of all, you can jump up quicker by reaching platforms that are <span style="color: lime;">at the same height as the character's jump and in your trajectory</span>.<br>
          By doing so, you will take less time to land on platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Landing on a platform <span style="color: orange;">too low</span>, <span style="color: lightcoral;">too high</span>, or <span style="color: orange;">outside your jump trajectory</span> make you lose time.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="block">
        <br><img src="screenshots/records9.png" class="center">
        <p>
          <strong>BLUE HOOPS:</strong><br>
          If you remember the location of the blue hoops, make sure to position yourself so you can have a chance to take them.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a series of blue hoops, The rings can guide you where the next blue hoop is located. Sometimes, you have to move in zigzags to pass through a series of blue hoops. 
        </p>

          <strong>DURING BOSS BATTLES:</strong><br>
          Dr. Eggman's machines and spike obstacles are moving in patterns. Learn the patterns to attack the machine at the right time. Otherwise, you will get hit by the obstacles.
        </p>
        <img src="screenshots/records10.png" class="center">
        <p>
          In some stages, Dr. Eggman is moving at the bottom of the area. When this happens, try to perform a double jump towards the machine around the same height.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, did you know you can actually deplete more health to Dr. Eggman's machines? To do so, perform a double jump towards the machine.
